Below are the third party library I used and why I use it.

1. react-web3: I tought we are going to make live data at first, that why I made connect wallet function. I decided to keep it after knowing we using mocking data, I hope this doesnt matter :P.
2. moment: I used it to format date.
3. react/spring: I used to do show the scrolling animation since I get lazy to write it from scratch :c.

Rest of the things you can see should all written by me that has no reference.
